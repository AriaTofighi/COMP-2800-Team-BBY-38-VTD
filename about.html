            VTD is made by a group of BCIT students in the CST program. Given the circumstances we had to face with COVID-19, group work ended up being awkward when we couldn't meet in person. However, it did little to slow us down. We chose to create a game that would be fun for us to make, and for you to play. Each of us worked hard to build this game, and we learned so much about the process behind developing applications.
