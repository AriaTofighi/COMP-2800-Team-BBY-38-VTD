        VTD was developed by a group of BCIT students in the CST program to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our game
        allows you to create a positive association with taking proper sanitary measures while having plenty of fun in
        stressful times.
        Given the circumstances we had to face, group work ended up being awkward as we couldn't meet in person.
        However, it did little to
        slow us
        down. We are passionate about making games and chose to create one that would be fun for us to make, and for you
        to play.
        Each of us worked hard to
        build this game, and we learned so much about the process behind developing applications and games.
